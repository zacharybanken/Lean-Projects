# Lean-Projects

Some Lean Theorem Prover files created during the UW WXML undergraduate research program. In fall quarter, I presented on proving the [division algorithm](https://github.com/zacharybanken/Lean-Projects/blob/main/src/div_alg2.lean). In spring quarter, I presented on [programming Lean tactics](https://github.com/zacharybanken/Lean-Projects/blob/main/WXML%20Poster%20Sp%2023.pdf).
